# rag

Overview
The Document QA Service is a modern application built with FastAPI that leverages advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to provide intelligent and accurate answers based on document content. By integrating LangChain and OpenAI technologies, this service efficiently processes and queries text documents to generate precise responses. The project comprises two main components: the FastAPI-based API service and the document processing and RAG setup.

Objectives
Document Handling: Load and preprocess documents from specified sources to prepare them for querying.
Vector Database Creation: Transform documents into vector representations and store them using FAISS for fast retrieval.
RAG Implementation: Configure and implement a RAG chain to combine document retrieval with generative responses.
API Development: Develop a RESTful API to allow users to submit questions and receive answers based on the processed documents.

Technology Stack
Python: Programming language used for development.
FastAPI: Framework for creating the web API.
Uvicorn: ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
LangChain: Library for handling document processing and RAG chain setup.
OpenAI: Service for generating embeddings and responses.
FAISS: Library for efficient vector similarity search.
